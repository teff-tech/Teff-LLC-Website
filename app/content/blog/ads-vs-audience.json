  "content": "Do you want to spend money for ads or do you want to grow your own audience? Both of them are going to require a lot of time, money, and effort. Do you want reach in the short term or do you want it in the long term? Long term means building your own audience; Building a loyal fan base that anytime you release anything new, it'll do well. That can take years to build, and most businesses don't have years to spare. Buying ads is a shortcut. Ads are cool, ads are great, but eventually it may eat into your margins enough that it can keep you from growing in the future. Maybe even put you out business. \n\nIs it worth building an audience early? I don't know? Depends on what your goals are. Maybe you can get away with the short term ads strategy but it's hard to justify doing the long term audience building when ads are is working. When ads don't work anymore, you're screwed because you didn't put the time or effort to build the audience years ago. \n\nIt's tempting. I don't wanna fall into that trap, so that's why I create content. Will I buy ads? Totally. That will happen, but right now I'm doing the groundwork. Maybe you should too.",
