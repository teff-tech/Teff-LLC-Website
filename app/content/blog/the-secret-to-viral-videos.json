This sounds simple but its a very hard thing to figure out. \n\nFirst step is to have a really engaging hook. Something compelling enough for a viewer to give your content a chance. This could be a compelling question or radical statement. It could even be something visually interesting that sparks a viewers curiosity. Without a good hook, it doesn't matter how good your content is. Here are some examples of hooks: \n\n* You cannot trust Canadians but not for the reasons you think.\n* Here's what will happen when you lose weight. \n* Engineers are the most meritocratic people you'll ever meet. \n\nEach of the above strikes a viewers curiosity which compelles them to consider watching the rest of the video. \n\nAfter a good hook, the goal is to retain the viewer as long as possible, by any means. This could involve cutting out filler words, slightly relevant tangents, stutters, and even breaths. It may not seem like it but each one of these impediments can interupt the attention of a viewer and cause them to skip your video. \n\nLastly: captions. Add captions to your videos. Captions are like attention black holes. They grab eyeballs and people cant help reading them.\n\nTry these out on your next videos and let us know how it goes.",
