  "content": "Who are we? A small software development outfit with a bit of edge. We love to challenge the status quo. We believe that social media and personal branding is the future of entertainment and communication. The tools available to address this space are archaic and geared towards marketers and businesses; not individuals. \n\\\nWe started this company to change that. Why? Because we are creators. We are artists, musicians, podcasters, streamers, editors, journalists, reporters, writers, and film makers. We've experienced the pain and struggle of growing and managing a social media brand. This shouldn't be hard. This shouldn't be time consuming. We should spend our time creating instead of distributing. So we're building solutions for that.",
